Ten Countries
The main goal of the project is to use open datasets to create a web application where the main focus is to link several xml files together and present content selected by us. The purpose of this task is to give us the opportunity to choose which open datasets we want to use for that task.

#### Ten Countries:

The choices we have made from data sources have been exchange rates taken from DNB and population in the world from WorldBank. The reason we chose these two data sources is because we wanted to create one application to find the currency for Norwegian kroner (NOK) converted to other currencies (eg USD or Peso), while showing population and practical information over ten selected countries.


#### Functions for Learner
